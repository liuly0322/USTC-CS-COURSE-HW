1. Files
-----------------------------------------------------------------
README		this file
Makefile	a makefile to build the example
expr.lex	a flex input file to define simple expressions
lex.yy.c	an expr lexical analyzer (scanner) generated by flex
expr.c		a expr analyzer which includes main() function and
		a manually coded getsym().  
expr.in		a simple expression test file
-----------------------------------------------------------------

2. Building an expr analyzer by calling a lexer generated by Flex
   $ make 
or
   $ make exprlex

3. Building an expr analyzer by calling the lexer mannually coded
   in expr.c.
   $ make expr

Note: we use a macro LEXERGEN to control which getsym() (in above 
      2 or 3) is called. If LEXERGEN is defined, the generated 
      lexer is called, otherwise the manually coded getsym() in
      expr.c is called.
