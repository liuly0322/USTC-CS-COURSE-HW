PL/0 Project's Source Tree
==========================

1. Introduction

PL/0 is similar to but much simpler than the general-purpose 
programming language Pascal, intended as an educational programming 
language. It serves as an example of how to construct a compiler. 
It was originally introduced in the book, 
            Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs, 
by Niklaus Wirth in 1975.  

This README contains basic information about building, and running
PL/0 compiler or your extended compiler.
If you're running on a Linux system, then just make sure you have
the standard GCC installed.

2. Source Tree
This PL/0 project distribution includes the following files and 
directories:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
README		this file
Makefile	a makefile to build PL/0 compiler or its extension
make.simple	a simple makefile to build PL/0 compiler
include		directory storing header files
src		directory storing source files
doc		directory storing documents
sample		directory storing sample test files and their results
test		directory storing your test files
bin		directory storing execution/objective files
-----------------------------------------------------------------

3. Building PL/0 compiler
(Build PL/0 compiler)
   $ make
or 
   $ make -f make.simple

(Clean PL/0 compiler)
   $ make clean
or 
   $ make -f make.simple clean

4. Running PL/0 compiler
   $ bin/pl0
   please input source program file name: test/tests.pl0
or   
   $ cd bin
   $ ./pl0
   please input source program file name: test/tests.pl0
or
   $ bin/pl0 >test/t.res
   then input "test/tests.pl0"
